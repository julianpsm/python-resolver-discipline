# Deduction Method

Look for a `function()` that gives you the `solution` ↓

1. How should the **solution** look like?
    - [ ] **Sketch** the `result` in a paper
2. Which is your starting `object`?
    - [ ] **Object**: DataFrame
3. Look for the `function()` that may solve your problem
    1. Within the `instance.↹`
        - `df.↹`
    2. Within the `module.↹`
        - `pandas.↹`
    3. Google it, see [how ↗︎](<02_Google Method.md>)
    4. *Rethink the question* to solve the problem
4. Apply **deduction with the autocompletion** to find the `function()`
5. Ask Python `shift + ↹` *how to use the function*
    1. <ins>Signature</ins>: for required parameters
    2. """<ins>Docstring</ins>""" to understand what the function does
    3. (<ins>Parameter</ins>=?): to know the objects you may use
    4. <ins>Return</ins>: to see what the function will output
    5. <ins>Examples</ins>: with code snippets
5. Which `object` should you pass to the `(parameters=?)`?
