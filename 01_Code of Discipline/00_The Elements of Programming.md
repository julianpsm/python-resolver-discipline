# The Elements of Programming

```python
another_object = module.function(parameter=object)
```

This are the key concepts you need to know about `Python` â†“

1. `module`: where the code of functions are stored
2. `.`: the **dot notation** to access the functions inside the library
3. `function()`: execute several lines of code with one `word()`
4. `(parameter=?)`: to **configure** the function's behaviour
5. `object`: **data structure** to store information
    1. `Class()`: to create the object
    2. `instance.`: once the object is created
