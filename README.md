# Python Resolver Discipline

This repo is the *[Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone)* you will always have in mind to train the **discipline** that will make you a **Python Resolver**.

If you master this minimalistic discipline, you will help most of your Python problems quickly.

You will even acquire the skill to face problems you haven't heard of before because you have a [solid foundation](02_Work%20out%20Discipline/../02_Work%20out%20Discipline/00_The%20Elements%20of%20Programming.md) to filter the solutions as you go.

You won't need to look at hundreds of University slides or book pages to find the solution that solves your problem.

The keystone of the discipline is the `function()`.

The **function** is the programming element that automates like 100 lines of code behind the scenes.

> The fact that you don't usually see them doesn't mean the computer is hardworking in the back.

Therefore, every single time you want to solve a problem, the **Python Resolver Discipline** makes you focus the question on the `function()`:

- **What is the `function()` that solves this problem?**

You will master 2 methods to reveal the `function()` you need:

1. [Deduction](02_Work%20out%20Discipline/01_Deduction%20Method.md)

    - You will deduce the solution by yourself, using standard English in a *jupyter notebook*.

2. [Google](02_Work%20out%20Discipline/02_Google%20Method.md)

    - You will know how to question in google to filter the best solutions in seconds.

Head over the materials and do a bit of research!

If you still have doubts, you can book a Session with me [here â†—](https://resolvingpython.as.me/)

I will be happy to explain the **Python Resolver Discipline** in detail with many practical cases.
