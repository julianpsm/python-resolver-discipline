## The Elements of Programming

```python
another_object = module.function(parameter=object)
```

This are the key concepts you need to know about `Python` ↓

1. `module`: where the code of functions are stored
2. `function()`: execute several lines of code with one `word()`
3. `(parameter=?)`: to **configure** the function's behaviour
4. `object`: **data structure** to store information
    1. `Class()`: to create the object
    2. `instance.`: once the object is created

## Deduction

Look for a `function()` that gives you the `solution` ↓

1. How the **solution** should look like?
    - [ ] Sketch the `result` in a paper
2. Which is your starting `object`?
3. Look for the `function()` that may solve your problem
    1. Within the `instance.↹`
    2. Within the `module.↹`
    3. [**google**](#google) it
    4. *Rethink the question* to solve the problem
4. Apply `deduction` with the **autocompletion** to find the `function()`
5. Ask Python `shift + ↹` *how to use the function*
    1. **Signature:** for required parameters
    2. **"""Docstring"""** to understand what the function does
    3. **(Parameters=?)** to know the objects you may use
    4. **Return** to see what the function will output
    5. **Examples** with code snippets
5. Which `object` should you pass to the `(parameters=?)`?

## Google

Apply the following steps when *looking for solutions in Google*:

1. What is the starting `object` you're working with?

    - [ ] **Object:** DataFrame

2. What's the `verb` of the action you want?

    - [ ] **Verb:** count

3. What's the `result` you want?

    - [ ] **Result:** number of repetitions in column

4. `google` the question

    - [ ] Refrase the question by keywords
        - ✅ dataframe count number of repetitions in column
        - ❌ ~~how to count the number of repetitions in python?~~

5. **Filter the Solution**
    1. Detect the `function()` that solves your problem
    2. **Copy-paste** the code into Python
    3. **Adapt the `parameters`** for your problem
