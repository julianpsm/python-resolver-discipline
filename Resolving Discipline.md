## The Elements of Programming

1. `module`: where the code of functions are stored.
2. `function()`: execute several lines of code with one `word()`.
3. `(parameter=?)`: to **configure** the function's behaviour.
4. `object`: **data structure** to store information.
   a. `class`: to create the object
   b. `instance`: once the object is created

## Deduction

1. Identify the **problem/error**
   - [ ] Which `object` are you working with?
2. How the **solution** should look like?
   - [ ] Sketch the `result` in a paper
3. Look for the `function()` that may solve your problem
    1. Within the `instance.↹`
    2. Within the `module.↹`
    3. [**google**](#google) it
    4. *Rethink the question* to solve the problem
4. Apply `deduction` with the **autocompletion** to find the `function()`
5. Ask Python `shift + ↹` *how to use the function*
    1. **Signature:** for required parameters
    2. **"""Docstring"""** to understand what the function does
    3. **(Parameters=?)** to know the objects you may use
    4. **Return** to see what the function will output
    5. **Examples** with code snippets
6. Which `object` should you pass to the `(parameters=?)`?

## Google

Apply the following steps when *looking for solutions in Google*:

1. **Necesity**
    - [ ] How to load an Excel in Python?

2. **Search in Google**
    - [ ] Refrase the question by keywords
  
    ```
    load excel python
    ~~how to load excel in python~~
    ```

3. **Filter the Solution**
    - [ ] What's the `function()` that loads an Excel in Python?
