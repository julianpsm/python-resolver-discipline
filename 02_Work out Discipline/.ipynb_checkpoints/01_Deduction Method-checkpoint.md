## Deduction Method

Look for a `function()` that gives you the `solution` ↓

1. How the **solution** should look like?
    - [ ] Sketch the `result` in a paper
2. Which is your starting `object`?
3. Look for the `function()` that may solve your problem
    1. Within the `instance.↹`
    2. Within the `module.↹`
    3. [**google**](#google) it
    4. *Rethink the question* to solve the problem
4. Apply `deduction` with the **autocompletion** to find the `function()`
5. Ask Python `shift + ↹` *how to use the function*
    1. **Signature:** for required parameters
    2. **"""Docstring"""** to understand what the function does
    3. **(Parameters=?)** to know the objects you may use
    4. **Return** to see what the function will output
    5. **Examples** with code snippets
5. Which `object` should you pass to the `(parameters=?)`?
